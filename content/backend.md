### Back End Development

Back End Development is about dealing with [databases](/databases) and building APIs so [Frontend Developers](/frontend) can use the [API](/basics#Application-Programming-Interface-API) to deal with data.

The Code that the Backend developer writes runs on the [server](/servers) or on the [cloud](/cloud).

### Rest API

Representational state transfer is a software architectural style which uses a subset of [HTTP](/basics#http-and-https). It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful. Rest is the most popular protocol.

We Get Data from Restful Web Services by endpoints for example an endpoint which returns posts and another which returns users.

### GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints. Access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint. GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for what’s possible and provide clear and helpful errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.

### Soap

SOAP is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality, verbosity and independence.

### Message Brokers

A message broker is software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information. The message broker does this by translating messages between formal messaging protocols. This allows interdependent services to “talk” with one another directly, even if they were written in different languages or implemented on different platforms.

### WebSockets

The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can build realtime apps like chat apps.
