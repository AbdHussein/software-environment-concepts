### [Programming Language:](# Programming-Language)

A programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program. Programmers use "high-level languages" to write programs. This code can be compiled into a "low-level language," which is understood by the computer hardware. Example of high-level languages include C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, etc...

### [Algorithms:](#Algorithms)

An algorithm is a set of detailed step-by-step instructions to complete a task

### [Data Structure:](#Data-Structure)

Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the software so that it can be used efficiently. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc

### [Application Programming Interface (API):](#Api)

An API is the bridge between the [client-side](/frontend) and the [server-side](/backend).

There are different Types of APIs and the most popular are [Rest](/backend#Rest) and [GrapghQL](/backend#GrapghQL).

The Backend Developer Program the API and The Frontend Developer uses it by sending [http requests (XHR)](#xhr) or opening [sockets](/backend#Sockets).

### [HTTP Request / Response:](#http-requests)

Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

1. A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
1. A web server receives the request
1. The server runs an application to process the request
1. The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
1. The client (the browser) receives the response

### [XHR:](#xhr)

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.

Data can be in different types like [Json](#json) or [XML](#xml).

### [Json:](#Json)

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

It is used mostly on the web and data transfer.

### [XML:](#xml)

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

XML is used mostly for [Android Development](/mobile-dev#android) and web services like [RSS feed](#rss) and [SOAP](/backend#soap).

### [RSS feed:](#RSS)

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication.
It allows you to syndicate your site content.
It defines an easy way to share and view headlines and content.
RSS files can be automatically updated.
RSS allows personalized views for different sites.
RSS is written in XML.
RSS is mostly used for Blogs and News Websites.
