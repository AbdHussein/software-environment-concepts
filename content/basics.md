### [Programming Language:](#Programming-Language)

A programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program. Programmers use "high-level languages" to write programs. This code can be compiled into a "low-level language," which is understood by the computer hardware. Example of high-level languages include C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, etc...

### [Algorithms:](#Algorithms)

An algorithm is a set of detailed step-by-step instructions to complete a task

### [Data Structure:](#Data-Structure)

Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the software so that it can be used efficiently. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc

### [Application Programming Interface (API):](#Api)

An API is the bridge between the [client-side](/frontend) and the [server-side](/backend).

There are different Types of APIs and the most popular are [Rest](/backend#Rest) and [GrapghQL](/backend#GrapghQL).

The Backend Developer Program the API and The Frontend Developer uses it by sending [http requests (XHR)](#xhr) or opening [websockets](/backend#websockets).

### HTTP Request / Response

Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

1. A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
1. A web server receives the request
1. The server runs an application to process the request
1. The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
1. The client (the browser) receives the response

### XHR

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.

Data can be in different types like [Json](#json) or [XML](#xml).

### Json

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

It is used mostly on the web and data transfer.

### XML

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

XML is used mostly for [Android Development](/mobile-dev#android) and web services like [RSS feed](#rss-feed) and [SOAP](/backend#soap).

### RSS feed

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication.
It allows you to syndicate your site content.
It defines an easy way to share and view headlines and content.
RSS files can be automatically updated.
RSS allows personalized views for different sites.
RSS is written in XML.
RSS is mostly used for Blogs and News Websites.

### Domain Name

Domain name is the address of your website that people type in the browser’s URL bar to visit your website.

In other words, if your website was a house, then your domain name will be its address.

### Hosting

Web hosting is the place where all the files of your website are stored. It is like the home of your website where it actually lives.

A good way to think about this is if the domain name was the address of your house, then web hosting is the actual house that address points to. All websites on the internet, need web hosting.

When someone enters your domain name in a browser, the domain name is translated into the IP address of your web hosting company’s computer (server) or yours. This computer contains your website’s files, and it sends those files back to the users’ browsers.

### version control system

A version control system is a kind of software that helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what change has been made.

The Most popular Version Control System Is [Git](/git).

### Git / GitHub

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

There are Multiple repo (folder) hosting services like GitHub (The Most Popular), GitLab and BitBucket.

### Package Managers

A package manager is a tool to create project environments and easily import external dependencies (packages)

Examples of package managers are NPM, Yarn, Composer and Chocolatey.
